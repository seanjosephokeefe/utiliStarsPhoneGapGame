# utiliStarsPhoneGapGame

This project is an HTML, JavaScript, CSS Project that I uploaded into PhoneGap.

It's set as iOS only in the config.xml file for PhoneGap.

There are 2 project directories at the root. There is one folder called HTML which contains all of the files that you can run in your browser.

There is also a folder called UtiliStars which is the Visual Studio project and at the root of that directory there is a solution file to run in Visual Studio.

I created this project as a proof-of-concept for a project that they are starting at my work.

Enjoy!!!!
